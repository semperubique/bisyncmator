# bisyncmator
A tool for two-directional synchronisation based on rsync.

## Warning
It is under development.

The app sync two directories in a bidirectional way. It was tested on two directories only containing modifiable files (text etc. not mp3's), and it is working so far. It will update the file if one directory is newer than the other one or if any file is deleted or added in one of the directories.
